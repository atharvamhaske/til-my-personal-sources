## ->today i learned by ~atharva 

**This will have all my learnings of golang, principal backends, frontends-ui, basics of system designs and also what open source projects i explored and what i learned from it**

*Pledge: "I will try atmost daily to maintain consistency and streak, as in tech you upskill or be irrelevant.This will be life long in all my ups and downs, all my pitfalls and lessons, lfgggggg"*


agenda: it will be just a maintained readme with links and code gists to easy use and revise whenever needed again in life just like we say: when we cross our paths again.
